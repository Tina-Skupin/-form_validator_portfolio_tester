## Issues to Address
XXXX

## Fixed issues:
1. **Email validation allows spaces** - The validator currently accepts emails containing spaces, which is incorrect according to RFC 5322. Need to add regex pattern or condition to reject these.

## Password Validation Tests
- [X] must be a string
- [] must be at least 10 long
- [] must contain at least 1 uppercase and 1 lowercase letter
